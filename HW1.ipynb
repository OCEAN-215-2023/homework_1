    "# Homework #1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due: Friday Oct. 13th @ 11:59 pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This assignment will give you experience using a Jupyter notebook to write text and code, including variables, mathematical operations, string, and list manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions:**\n",
    "### Accessing Class Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new **_private_** repository on your GitHub and name it \"homework_1\". This will be your personal GitHub repository that you will submit to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to the class GitHub Homework 1 [repository](https://github.com/OCEAN-215-2023/homework_1). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find the **SSH** URL (review Assignment #0b if you don't remember how to do this), and copy the URL to your clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In your JupyterHub terminal, change to your home directory. Run this line of code to clone the public classic repository into your local server: \n",
    "> ``` git clone git@github.com:OCEAN-215-2023/homework_1.git ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sometimes, our JupyterHub server has trouble remembering the file permissions for our SSH keys. If you get a file permission error with your private ssh key, run this line of code:\n",
    "> ```chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. There should now be a \"homework_1\" directory in the home directory of your JupyterHub. In terminal, change directories into \"homework_1\". Next, click on the the \"homework_1\" icon on the filepath hierarchy in the left panel of JupyterHub. If you don't see it, make sure you're in the home folder by clicking the folder icon under the search bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. In terminal, set your branch to main (step 17 in #0b) and your remote (origin) to your **_personal_** \"homework_1\" GitHub repository (step 18).  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Double click the \"HW1.ipynb\" to open it in a new tab and begin working on the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Create a README file and write your name and UW NetID. You can also include other information, such as how you used git to add, commit, and push to your GitHub if you want more practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. As you continue to answer the homework questions and make edits to your code, make sure to regularly update your GitHub repository as well via git add, commit, and push (steps 15, 16, 19). A good rule of thumb would be to run these git steps anytime you make an addition or change that you don't want to accidentally lose. Generally, you can push once a day to maintain good version control. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting to GradeScope\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Go to the class Gradescope dashboard and submit your **_private_** GitHub repository link to Homework 1 assignment. Make sure your GitHub is synchronized with Gradescope to access both your public _and_ private repositories. If prompted, log in to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Run the autograder to check if your code runs and if you passed the initial unit tests. You should be able to run the autograder as many times as you want before submitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Make sure to double check that you have submitted the assignment. If you make any more changes to your code after submitting to Gradescope, make sure to push your changes to GitHub and resubmit the assignment on Gradescope. You can submit as many times as you want as there is no maximum submission attempts, but be sure to have your final submission in before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honor Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the assignment by writing and executing text and code cells as specified. For this assignment, do not use any features of Python that have not yet been discussed in the lessons or class sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please keep in mind our late work and dropped homework grading policy. Review the syllabus for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the space below, you can acknowledge and describe any assistance you've received on this assignment, whether that was from an instructor, classmate (either directly or on Piazza), and/or online resources other than official Python documentation websites like docs.python.org or numpy.org. Alternatively, if you prefer, you may acknowledge assistance at the relevant point(s) in your code using a Python comment (#). Don't forget that you can receive extra credit from answering at least one question on Ed Discussion!"

    "Although the goal of OCEAN 215 is not to teach \"data science\" per se, we hope this course will give you a window into the possibilities offered by data analysis. If you find that you enjoy working with data and writing computer code, you might want to consider a career in academic research or data science. But what is data science, precisely? To better understand this rapidly-growing field, we would like you to read the following article (which should take about 15 minutes), then answer the questions below. There are no wrong answers, but please respond thoughtfully with 2-3 sentences for each. \n",

Can you think of a research question or task in oceanography or your academic area of interest that might benefit from machine learning? Why might machine learning be particularly useful for that task (10 points)?"
